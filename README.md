Code for the paper ["Sensor-Based Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Detection With Personalised Federated Learning"](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLA52953.2021.00058).

The mental illness Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterised by obsessive thoughts and compulsive actions. The latter can occur as repetitive activities to ensure that severe fears do not come true. A diagnosis of the disease is usually very late due to a lack of knowledge and shame of the patient. Nevertheless, early detection can significantly increase the success of therapy.With the development of new wearable sensors, it is possible to recognise human activities. Accordingly, wearables can also be used to identify recurring activities that indicate an OCD. Through this form of an automatic detection system, a diagnosis can be made earlier and thus therapy can be started sooner.Since compulsive behaviour is very individual and varies from patient to patient, this paper deals with personalised federated machine learning models. We first adapt the publicly available OPPORTUNITY dataset to simulate OCD behaviour. Secondly, we evaluate two existing personalised federated learning algorithms against baseline approaches. Finally, we propose a hybrid approach that merges the two evaluated algorithms and reaches a mean area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.954 across clients.
